Introduction to dataset/engine:

dataset/engine supports various formats of datasets, including ImageNet, TFData,
MNIST, Cifar10/100, Manifest, MindRecord, etc. This module could load data in
high performance and parse data precisely. It also provides the following
operations for users to preprocess data: shuffle, batch, repeat, map, and zip.
