class Exp(PowerTransform):

    Exponential Bijector.
    This Bijector performs the operation:

    .. math::
        Y = exp(x).

    Args:
        name (str): The name of the Bijector. Default: 'Exp'.

    Examples:
        >>> # To initialize an Exp bijector.
        >>> import mindspore.nn.probability.bijector as msb
        >>> n = msb.Exp()
        >>>
        >>> # To use an Exp bijector in a network.
