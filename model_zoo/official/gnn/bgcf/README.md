# [Bayesian Graph Collaborative Filtering](#contents)

Bayesian Graph Collaborative Filtering(BGCF) was proposed in 2020 by Sun J, Guo W, Zhang D et al. By naturally incorporating the 
uncertainty in the user-item interaction graph shows excellent performance on Amazon recommendation dataset.This is an example of
training of BGCF with Amazon-Beauty dataset in MindSpore. More importantly, this is the first open source version for BGCF.

[Paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3394486.3403254): Sun J, Guo W, Zhang D, et al. A Framework for Recommending Accurate and Diverse Items Using Bayesian Graph Convolutional Neural Networks[C]//Proceedings of the 26th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining. 2020: 2030-2039.

# [Model Architecture](#contents)

Specially, BGCF contains two main modules. The first is sampling, which produce sample graphs based in node copying. Another module
aggregate the neighbors sampling from nodes consisting of mean aggregator and attention aggregator.

# [Dataset](#contents)
Note that you can run the scripts based on the dataset mentioned in original paper or widely used in relevant domain/network architecture. In the following sections, we will introduce how to run the scripts using the related dataset below.
- Dataset size:
  Statistics of dataset used are summarized as below:
  
  |                    |           Amazon-Beauty | 
  | ------------------ | -----------------------:| 
  | Task               |   Recommendation        | 
  | # User             | 7068 (1 graph)          | 
  | # Item             |           3570          | 
  | # Interaction      |           79506         | 
  | # Training Data    |           60818         |  
  | # Test Data        |           18688         |   
  | # Density          |           0.315%        |  

- Data Preparation
  - Place the dataset to any path you want, the folder should include files as follows(we use Amazon-Beauty dataset as an example)"
  ```
  .
  └─data
      ├─ratings_Beauty.csv
  ```

  - Generate dataset in mindrecord format for Amazon-Beauty.
  ```builddoutcfg
  cd ./scripts
  # SRC_PATH is the dataset file path you download.
  sh run_process_data_ascend.sh [SRC_PATH]
  ```
  
  
# [Features](#contents)

## Mixed Precision

To ultilize the strong computation power of Ascend chip, and accelerate the training process, the mixed training method is used. MindSpore is able to cope with FP32 inputs and FP16 operators. In BGCF example, the model is set to FP16 mode except for the loss calculation part.

# [Description of random situation](#contents)

BGCF model contains lots of dropout operations, if you want to disable dropout, set the neighbor_dropout to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] in src/config.py.
